    "Feature Engineering Pipeline - with TFX\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, you will continue exploring [Tensorflow Transform](https://www.tensorflow.org/tfx/transform/get_started). This time, it will be in the context of a machine learning (ML) pipeline. In production-grade projects, you want to streamline tasks so you can more easily improve your model or find issues that may arise. [Tensorflow Extended (TFX)](https://www.tensorflow.org/tfx) provides components that work together to execute the most common steps in a machine learning project. If you want to dig deeper into the motivations behind TFX and the need for machine learning pipelines, you can read about it in [this paper](https://storage.googleapis.com/pub-tools-public-publication-data/pdf/b500d77bc4f518a1165c0ab43c8fac5d2948bc14.pdf) and in this [blog post](https://blog.tensorflow.org/2020/09/brief-history-of-tensorflow-extended-tfx.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "You will build end-to-end pipelines in future courses but for this one, you will only build up to the feature engineering part. Specifically, you will:\n",
    "\n",
    "* ingest data from a base directory with `ExampleGen`\n",
    "* compute the statistics of the training data with `StatisticsGen`\n",
    "* infer a schema with `SchemaGen`\n",
    "* detect anomalies in the evaluation data with `ExampleValidator`\n",
    "* preprocess the data into features suitable for model training with `Transform`\n",
    "\n",
    "If several steps mentioned above sound familiar, it's because the TFX components that deal with data validation and analysis (i.e. `StatisticsGen`, `SchemaGen`, `ExampleValidator`) uses [Tensorflow Data Validation (TFDV)](https://www.tensorflow.org/tfx/data_validation/get_started) under the hood. You're already familiar with this library from the exercises in Week 1 and for this week, you'll see how it fits within an ML pipeline.\n",

    "**Congratulations!** You have now executed all the components in our pipeline. You will get hands-on practice as well with training and model evaluation in future courses but for now, we encourage you to try exploring the different components we just discussed. As mentioned earlier, a useful exercise for the upcoming assignment is to be familiar with using different `tft` functions in your transform module. Try exploring the [documentation](https://www.tensorflow.org/tfx/transform/api_docs/python/tft) and see what other functions you can use in the transform module. You can also do the optional challenge below for more practice.\n",

    "**Optional Challenge:** Using this notebook as reference, load the [Seoul Bike Sharing Demand Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Seoul+Bike+Sharing+Demand) and run it through the five stages of the pipeline discussed here. You will first go through the data ingestion and validation components then finally, you will study the dataset's features and transform it to a format that a model can consume. Once you're done, you can visit this [Discourse topic](https://community.deeplearning.ai/t/bike-sharing-dataset-in-c2-w2-lab-2-feature-engineering-pipeline/38979) where one of your mentors, Fabio, has shared his solution. Feel free to discuss and share your solution as well!"
